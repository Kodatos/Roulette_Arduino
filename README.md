# Roulette_Arduino
A score based roulette game using Arduino and an I/O expansion board.

An Arduino Nano was interfaced with a custom built I/O expansion board, which included LEDs with charlieplexing, switches, buttons, sensors and seven segment displays.
The rotation is simulated in the 6 charlieplexed LEDs placed in a circle. The player first selects one LED and the game is started with the rotation completely randomized.
The score is maintained and displayed in the 7 segment displays. A fun little game in all!
